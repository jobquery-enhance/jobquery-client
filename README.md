## Technology Stack

- Angular.js

## Local System Prerequisites
- Node.JS
- MongoDB
- bower
- npm

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone both the jobquery-client and jobquery-server to your local machine.
1. In both repos, run `npm install` and `bower install` from main directory.
1. Start a local instance of mongo by typing `mongod` in the terminal.
  - You will need to import data into the local DB. Contact a group admin.
1. In another terminal tab, run `node server.js` in `jobquery-server/`.
1. In a third terminal tab, run `gulp devserve` in `jobquery-client/`.
1. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.

## To Run End-to-End Tests
Reference the Angular Protractor [tutorial](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/tutorial).

### Setup

1. Install Protractor globally using `npm install -g protractor`.
1. Update the webdrivers using `webdriver-manager update`.
1. Create a file named `test/E2E/privateInfo.js` with usernames, passwords, etc. The setup at this time is:

        exports.admin = ['someemail@email.com', 'password'];

        exports.user = ['someemail@email.com', 'password'];
1. Start the selenium server in a new terminal tab: `webdriver-manager start`.
1. Run jobQuery locally, see steps above.

There should be four tabs open:
- Server
- MongoDB
- Client
- Selenium server

### Run
In a fifth terminal window, navigate to `jobquery-client/test/E2E/conf.js` and enter `protractor conf.js` to run tests.

Tests currently complete in around 30 seconds.
